# Data Model

* **Login (Sprint 1):** Using Django's Allauth library, this model stores user login credentials, like username and password. It also tracks `created_on` and `updated_on` timestamps, although not used in this project. This allows for potential tracking of user activity for marketing purposes.

* **Guests (Sprint 1):** This model stores guest information, including `guest_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, `city`, `postcode`, `phone_number`, `email`, `reason_for_visit`, `created_on`, `updated_on`, and `last_visit` dates. The `guest_id` has a one-to-many relationship with the `Reservation` model, enabling a guest to have multiple reservations. This model is central to enabling [**Please clarify what this model enables. What functionality does it provide?]**

* **Experiences (Sprint 1):** This model stores information about available spa experiences, including `experience_id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `image`. Experience coordinators can create and publish new experiences. Experiences have a one-to-many relationship with `Reservations`. One experience can be associated with multiple reservations.

* **Reservations (Sprint 1):** This model is central to all other models and brings together reservation details, including `reservation_id`, `reservation_date`, `experience` (foreign key to `Experiences`), `reservation_price`, `number_of_guests`, and `enhancements`. The `reservation_id` ensures that experiences can only be edited by the correct guest.

* **Payment (Sprint 2):** This model stores payment information, including `payment_id`, `payment_date`, `payment_amount`, `created_on`, and `updated_on`. This will be included in Sprint two.

* **Enhancements (Sprint 2):** This model stores details about available enhancements, including `enhancement_id`, `enhancement_name`, `enhancement_description`, `image`, `enhancement_price`, `quantity`, and `created_on`. These would be used if a guest wanted to make their stay extra special with champagne, chocolates, or flowers.

* **Review (Sprint 2):** This model stores customer reviews, including `review_id`, `review_date`, `review_text`, and `created_on`.

# Agile Project Management

This project utilised agile project management techniques, with Monday.com serving as the primary project management tool.
![alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dybts6jei/image/upload/v1742209022/Register_models_to_admin_site_-_Admin_Site_gi5wf3.png)

### Monday.com Setup

* The project was organised into epics based on user profiles.
* Each task included status, priority, and type attributes.
* Monday.com was integrated with GitHub to link issues, commits, and tasks.
* A Kanban board was used to visualise and manage the workflow, connecting issues to individual tasks.

### Project Management and Agile Mapping
The project utilised an Agile methodology, with planning and task management originally tracked on a monday.com board.

## Known Bugs

|Bug|Description|Planned Fix|
|---|-----------|-----------|
|**Users can select dates in the past** | The reservation form currently allows users to pick and submit dates that have already passed. | Add client-side and server-side validation to restrict date selection to today or future dates|
|**Experience selector**|Regardless of which experience brought the user to the reservation page, they must still select the experience from the dropdown list.|Pre-select the experience in the dropdown based on the user's previous selection or navigation path.|
|**Autofill experience** | When a user edits a reservation, the previously selected experience is not automatically populated in the dropdown. The user must manually re-select the experience. |Ensure the form pre-selects the original experience when editing a reservation.|
|**CSP inline style violation** | Used `unsafe-inline` for the Content Secruity Policy blocks inline styles to circumvent errors | Long term fix would be use hashes or nounces for secure inline style usage |
